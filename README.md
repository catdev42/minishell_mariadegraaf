*A mini recreation of bash.  Implementing previously learned concepts like file descriptors and processes.  Made with [Alfred Polycarpe](https://github.com/Alfredpoly).*

## The Challenge
This was probably the biggest project I've done so far, as well as the first one I did as a group.  The goal was to create a mini version of bash, I say mini but it was still a huge project.  We had to learn how bash takes arguments, parses them, and executes them. We had to incorporate the following features:
- Display a promt while waiting for a new commmand.
- Have a working history.
- Find and launch executables (using the `PATH` variable or an absolute path).
- Handle `'` (single) and `"` (double) **quotes** like in bash.
- Implement **redirections** such as:
  - `<` redirect input.
  - `>` redirect output.
  - `<<` heredoc (doesn't affect history).
  - `>>` redirect output in append mode.
- Implement `|` (**pipes**).
- Handle **environment variables**.
- Handle `$?`.
- `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D`, and `ctrl-\` should behave like in bash.
- Recreate the following **builtins**:
  - `echo` with option `-n`.
  - `cd` with only a relative or absolute path.
  - `pwd` (no flags).
  - `export` (no flags).
  - `unset` (no flags).
  - `env` (no flags or arguments).
  - `exit` (no flags).

We didn't have to implement && and ||, or wildcards, as well as any special symbols that weren't specifically asked for.  We were also told that when in doubt, take bash as a reference.  This sometimes led to discussions on wether or not we had to implement something, the result of which was usually "probably??? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è".

### What Is Bash and How Does It Work?
The shell is a program that the user can use to interact with an operating system's services. Bash is the GNU shell, and is currently the most common shell program.  We took the challenge of recreating bash very literally, so the first thing we did was learn how bash actually works with the help of [this article](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/grr/SystemsProgrammingBook/Book/Chapter5-WritingYourOwnShell.pdf).  Essentially it breaks down the process into 4 steps: `lexer` ‚Üí `parser` ‚Üí `expander` ‚Üí `executor`, which we replicated in our project.

I'll delve further into each step in the implementation section bellow.

## Implementation

The program is run without arguments (and will throw an error if any are used).  A command prompt will then show up, which implemented through [readline](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readline.3.html), which was recommended by the subject.  This also allowed us to use the built-in history function.  Once a line has been inputted it checks for any unclosed quotes.  If it doesn't find any it sends the line to the lexer.

### The Lexer
The lexer takes as the entered line as input. It then reads through the line word by word, using white space as delimiters.  First it checks wether or not the word is a token, ie: `|`, `<`, `<<`, `>`, or `>>`, and otherwise it assumes it is a word.  Which it then adds to the following linked list:

```C
typedef struct s_lexer
{
	char			*str;
	t_tokens		token;
	int				i;
	struct s_lexer	*next;
	struct s_lexer	*prev;
}	t_lexer;
```
Each node contains either a string containing the word or a token.  We also assign each node an index, this is so that we can easily delete them later.
